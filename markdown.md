## 2. Abstract Summary

- **Predictive Anomaly Detection:** Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) algorithms achieve R²=0.997 for inlet pressure prediction, enabling real-time fault identification.
- **Cybersecurity Integration:** Parallel DT architecture physically isolated from networks acts as a "safety switch" during cyber intrusions.
- **Human-DT Integration:** Part of EU-funded RESIST project, combining plant DT with operator DT for stress scenario simulation.  
  _Alignment: Directly addresses practical implementation of predictive maintenance (Goal 1) and cybersecurity (Goal 3), while exploratory human-DT integration extends to adaptive training (Goal 2)._

## 3. Overview/Introduction

**Problem Statement:** Oil/gas systems face cyber-physical threats (e.g., PID tampering, data spoofing) with cascading safety risks. Existing DTs lack comprehensive component interdependency modeling.  
**DT Role:** High-fidelity replica of experimental transport system using real PID controllers, enabling:

- Real-time monitoring via MQTT protocol
- Anomaly detection via T² Hotelling statistics
- Safe simulation of cyber-attacks (e.g., PID shutdown)  
  **Gaps Addressed:**
- Limited real-world DT applications
- Incomplete system behavior modeling
- Cybersecurity strategy gaps in DT protection
